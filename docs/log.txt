20170525
	+ set up project
	+ researched java swing drawing options
20170526
	+ city names are drawn to canvas
	+ put drawing control into scroll pane
	+ created closest pair class
	+ drew voronoi diagram lines using raw distance without reach check.
	+ draw voronoi diagram lines using reach comparison and closest two map.
20170527
	+ assigned cities random colors and color the areas closest to them that color
	+ fixed intvector2 distance estimation formula to be more continuous
	+ changed color of city dot to a lighter version of the city's color
	+ made a separate city dot drawing method
	+ sort city list by population automatically
	+ made an alternate map filler that uses a queue and pushes all city point seeds simultaneously to start
	+ saved to image
20170528
	+ researched and tested polygon drawing in java (early morning)
	+ drew outlines of land (afternoon and night)
20170603
	+ drew outlines of canada and puerto rico
	+ added puerto rican cities	
20170605
	+ made hash map for city lookup by position
	+ sized hash map tile entries to 100 units both horizontally and vertically (100x100)
	+ put cities into tiles to make searching faster
	+ automatically linked cities using octants and quadrants
20170606 (1)
	+ allowed user to modify city separation distance with a text box or tick control.
	+ add a checkbox to tell the application to only use cities separated some distance from cities already on the map
	+ add gui controls for city map tile size, use diagonal neighbor-city directions, and max dist to scan for neighbors
	+ drew lines between connected cities
	+ drew those lines behind the city names
20170606 (2)
	+ added more waypoint cities from the united states and canada
	+ had to update spreadsheet to adjust for new cities
	+ changed reach to logarithm with base of 3
20170607
	+ ensure that two neighboring cities have distinguishable colors
	+ made a checkbox that controls the hiding and showing of connection lines
	+ added my own borders for american states that reflect coastlines
	+ added waco, tx
20170608
	+ draft cities into regions using a similar procedure to that used for state draft
	+ when drawing city region links, draw thick region-colored lines under the white faded lines that show all links between cities
	+ give regions a color
	+ found a way to limit region size by number of cities or even population (more complex)
	+ limited region size by number of cities divided by number of regions
20170610
	+ use genetic algorithm to find a more optimal region layout by swapping random cities between regions every generation
	+ remembered to avoid breaking region contiguity when swapping cities between regions
	+ finished city country evolver using genetic algorithm
	+ fixed region drawer by making a list of city-connections already drawn
	+ made a CityConnection class
20170611 (1)
	+ added total distance from center for each region to the fitness score 
	+ added function to merge puny neighboring regions 	
	+ spent 14 hours coding and debugging today (yikes)
20170611 (2)
	+ did another city-transfer function that steps through large regions downwards and small regions upwards until a city is found that touches both cities and does not 
	  break contiguity when removed from its old region.  gave the city to the smaller region from the larger region. 
	+ used a nested for loop like the one used in puny merge to step through the new city transfer function
	+ added spinner box control for max city population to be used in conjunction with the existing min city population spinner
in-progress
to-do
	- draw outlines of other regions
	- add more cities from around the world
	- find a way to avoid writing text to the same y coord if the x coords of two cities are close
	- add a toggle button to control whether boundaries get drawn
	- make a button to toggle outline drawing on and off
	- draw city names with partial opacity
	- add borders and cities for both the caribbean and mexico
	- have a list of universities as an alternative and do the same thing as with cities
	- make regions of a fixed number of cities and represent them by line connections between cities
	- make "dimensions" for elevation, ruggedness, moisture, two political axes, ethnic axes, and religious axes, in addition to cartesian x and y
	- use dimensions to compare distance between cities in all dimensions using taxicab metric
	- add Region comparator to sort regions by size
	- add button to clear console output and get it to actually do what it says
	- add spinner box controls for min and max number of generated regions
